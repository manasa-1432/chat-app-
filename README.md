**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**NAME**: KARE MANASA  
**INTERN ID**: CT04DH1654  
**DOMAIN**: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT  
**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH  


This project is a **Real-Time Chat Application** developed using **ReactJS for frontend** and **Node.js + Socket.io for backend**. The goal was to implement WebSocket-based two-way communication where users can send and receive messages instantly.

The backend uses Express and Socket.io to handle real-time communication and broadcasting messages to all connected users. The frontend React app connects via `socket.io-client`, manages state using React hooks, and dynamically renders the chat log.

Core Features:
- Real-time message exchange
- WebSocket connection via Socket.io
- Scalable frontend using React
- Responsive chat interface

The application mimics the working of apps like WhatsApp or Messenger and provides hands-on experience in full-stack communication systems.
